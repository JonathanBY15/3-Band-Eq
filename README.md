<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

FineTune is a lightweight 3-band equalizer designed to help users shape their sound with ease. Whether you're cutting out unwanted frequencies or enhancing your audio mix, FineTune provides a simple yet effective solution with an intuitive UI.

### Why FineTune?
Throughout college, I had a low-budget laptop that struggled with resource-heavy audio software. I needed a lightweight equalizer that allowed me to work on music without crashes or lag. FineTune was built with efficiency in mind, ensuring smooth performance even on modest hardware.

### Features
- **3-Band Equalizer** – Adjust low, mid, and high frequencies.
- **Lightweight & Fast** – Designed for performance on low-spec machines.
- **User-Friendly UI** – Simple and intuitive controls for quick adjustments.
- **Real-Time Processing** – Hear the changes instantly as you tweak the settings.

### Built With
- C++
- JUCE Framework
